  <h1>What is tablogging?</h1>
  <p>Tablogging is weird.
  It's not really sharing links, but it kind of is. 
  It's sharing a whole bunch of links at once.
  Not to share the links exactly, though you can visit the links if you want.
  I guess it's trying to capture what you're doing on the internet, really quickly.
  I wanted to share what I was looking at, but sharing is hard, and you can't do it too much.
  </p>
  <p>
  I built a Chrome extension that captures the titles and URLs of all your open tabs, and
  then sends the information to another page (say, <a href="http://matthewpalmer.net/tablog/">my tablog</a>) to display all of your tablogs.
  So, with one click, I can share what I'm up to.
  </p>
  <p>I bet that cleared nothing up.</p>
